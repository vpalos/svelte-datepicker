This package was forked from `@beyonk/svelte-datepicker` and then cleaned-up and updated to use `svelte-package` to generate importable Svelte components that play nicely in other codebases (such as MeteorJS apps).

## Svelte-DateRangePicker

Features:

-   Calendar
-   Date Picker
-   Date Range Picker
-   Time Selection
-   Context-aware theming
-   Toolbar

Roadmap:

-   Setup the demo/test page.
-   Improve documentation.

## Usage

-   `npm install svelte-daterangepicker`
-   use Svelte components only from under the `.../dist` folder;
    -   this is crucial - given how Svelte components are compiled - so that this will play well with your app;
-   build and run your app normally.
